# Phasmophobia web APP (unoffical)

This little application helps you to identify the correct ghost by combining or exclude some evidence.

Like the in-game manual, you can filter remaining ghosts possibilities by check to "YES" evidence found.
But also have a view of which combinations of evidence are possible or not. 
You can also check evidence as "NO"  to exclude ghost with this one.

This APP also provide a timer to keep an eye on it during the ghost research.

Available in French / English / Partially Japanese 

/!\ This is not a cheat ! Just an interactive guide!

- Freezing temperature

This app display that there is only two possibilities: Demon or Yurei
It also tells you that you don't need to search "EMF" or "Fingerprint" but "Spirit box" or "Ghost orb"

## Example 02: Exclude evidences
![Img 01](https://phasmophobia.bidoum.fr/img/Screenshot02.jpg)

You found one evidence: "Fingerprints"

You are sure there is no "Spirit box" after having tried to call him during 5mn...

The APP filter the ghost with "Fingerprint" and no "Spirit box" to found two results : "Banshee" and "Revenant", and then is able to directly tell you to search for "Book" "Temperature" or "EMF" but not for "Ghost Orb"
